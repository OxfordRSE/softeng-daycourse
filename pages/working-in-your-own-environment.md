# Working in your own environment

To set-up your own development environment, you will need to install the following software:
- Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Github Desktop (https://desktop.github.com/download/)
- Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)

To download repositories from Github, use Github Desktop, or the terminal:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

To push changes to Github from VS Code or the terminal (`git push`) you will need to provide Github with an SSH key to identify yourself. Follow the instructions here: [https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent). _Note that Github Desktop will allow you to push changes without configuring an SSH key, and you may find this easier in the short-term._
