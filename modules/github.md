# Licensing

### No license

<div class="h-10" />

- If you find software that doesn’t have a license, that generally means you have **no permission** from the creators of the software to use, modify, or share the software
- Where there are other contributors, they are license holders for their contributions, meaning **you** do not have permission to use, modify or share their contributions
- If hosted on github the authors will have agreed to github’s own Terms of Service which permits others to view and fork your repository (for public repositories)
