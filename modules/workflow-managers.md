# Workflow managers

A tool to create **reproducible** and **scalable** data analyses.

Workflows are described via a human **readable, Python based language**.

They can be **seamlessly scaled** to server, cluster, grid and cloud environments, without the need to modify the workflow definition.

Workflows can entail a **description of required software**, which will be automatically deployed to any execution environment.

Scheduling heuristic is applied to
Maximise parallelization
Prefer high priority jobs
Subject to resource constraints

Disjoint paths in DAG can be executed in parallel

- Clone repository with three well-defined functions / packages, and a scaffolded Snakefile (enter static filename, explore dag, execution, etc; then switch to wildcards to process the full set)
- Note how reprocessing only impacts out-of-date files / scripts
